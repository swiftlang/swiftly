```
$ swiftly install main-snapshot
$ swiftly run swift test +main-snapshot   # Run "swift test" with the main-snapshot toolchain
$ swift build                             # Continue to build with my usual toolchain
```

Uninstall this toolchain after you're finished with it:

```
$ swiftly uninstall main-snapshot
```

# Proxy

Swiftly downloads a list of toolchains from https://www.swift.org/ and retrieves them from Apple/Akamai CDN via https://download.swift.org.
If your environment requires a proxy, Swiftly will attempt to use the standard environment variables `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `https_proxy` or `HTTPS_PROXY` to determine which proxy server to use instead of making a direct connection.

To download latest nightly snapshot using a proxy:
```
$ export https_proxy=http://proxy:3128
$ swiftly install main-snapshot
```
