## update

Update an installed toolchain to a newer version.

```
swiftly update [<toolchain>] [--assume-yes] [--verbose] [--verify|no-verify] [--post-install-file=<post-install-file>] [--version] [--help]
```

**toolchain:**

*The installed toolchain to update.*


Updating a toolchain involves uninstalling it and installing a new toolchain that is newer than it.

If no argument is provided to the update command, the currently in-use toolchain will be updated. If that toolchain is a stable release, it will be updated to the latest patch version for that major.minor version. If the currently in-use toolchain is a snapshot, then it will be updated to the latest snapshot for that development branch.

    $ swiftly update

The string "latest" can be provided to update the installed stable release toolchain with the newest version to the latest available stable release. This may update the toolchain to later major, minor, or patch versions.

    $ swiftly update latest

A specific stable release can be updated to the latest patch version for that release by specifying the entire version:

    $ swiftly update 5.6.0

Omitting the patch in the specified version will update the latest installed toolchain for the provided minor version to the latest available release for that minor version. For example, the following will update the latest installed Swift 5.4 release toolchain to the latest available Swift 5.4 release:

    $ swiftly update 5.4

Similarly, omitting the minor in the specified version will update the latest installed toolchain for the provided major version to the latest available release for that major version. Note that this may update the toolchain to a later minor version.

    $ swiftly update 5

The latest snapshot toolchain for a given development branch can be updated to the latest available snapshot for that branch by specifying just the branch:

    $ swiftly update 5.7-snapshot
    $ swiftly update main-snapshot

A specific snapshot toolchain can be updated by including the date:

    $ swiftly update 5.9-snapshot-2023-09-20
    $ swiftly update main-snapshot-2023-09-20


**--assume-yes:**

*Disable confirmation prompts by assuming 'yes'*


**--verbose:**

*Enable verbose reporting from swiftly*


**--verify|no-verify:**

*Verify the toolchain's PGP signature before proceeding with installation.*


**--post-install-file=\<post-install-file\>:**

*A file path to a location for a post installation script*

If the toolchain that is installed has extra post installation steps they they will be
written to this file as commands that can be run after the installation.

## run

Run a command while proxying to the selected toolchain commands.

```
swiftly run <command>... [--version] [--help]
```

**command:**

*Run a command while proxying to the selected toolchain commands.*


Run a command with a selected toolchain. The toolchain commands become the default in the system path.

You can run one of the usual toolchain commands directly:

    $ swiftly run swift build

Or you can run another program (or script) that runs one or more toolchain commands:

    $ CC=clang swiftly run make  # Builds targets using clang
    $ swiftly run ./build-things.sh  # Script invokes 'swift build' to create certain product binaries

Toolchain selection is determined by swift version files `.swift-version`, with a default global as the fallback. See the `swiftly use` command for more details.

You can also override the selection mechanisms temporarily for the duration of the command using a special syntax. An argument prefixed with a '+' will be treated as the selector.

    $ swiftly run swift build +latest
    $ swiftly run swift build +5.10.1

The first command builds the swift package with the latest toolchain and the second selects the 5.10.1 toolchain. Note that if these aren't installed then run will fail with an error message. You can pre-install the toolchain using `swiftly install <toolchain>` to ensure success.

If the command that you are running needs the arguments with the '+' prefixes then you can escape it by doubling the '++'.

    $ swiftly run ./myscript.sh ++abcde

The script will receive the argument as '+abcde'. If there are multiple arguments with the '+' prefix that should be escaped you can disable the selection using a '++' argument, which turns off any selector argument processing for subsequent arguments. This is anologous to the '--' that turns off flag and option processing for subsequent arguments in many argument parsers.

    $ swiftly run ./myscript.sh ++ +abcde +xyz

The script will receive the argument '+abcde' followed by '+xyz'.
